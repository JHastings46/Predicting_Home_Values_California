# Predicting_Home_Values_California
A machine learning project to predict California house values while addressing multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity.

## Overview
This project aims to predict median house values in California using features like income, proximity to coastal regions, and housing characteristics. The goal is to develop a robust machine learning model that addresses challenges such as multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, and feature selection.

## Data Source
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle: [California Housing Prices Dataset](<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/california-housing-prices-data-extra-features>).

## Key Features
- **EDA**: Heatmaps, pair plots, and descriptive statistics.
- **Feature Engineering**: Log transformation of the target variable to stabilize variance.
- **Model Selection**: Ridge regression with hyperparameter tuning to address multicollinearity.
- **Evaluation**: Comparison of models using metrics like R-squared, MAE, and MSE.

## Deliverables
1. **Jupyter Notebook**: Includes all EDA, feature engineering, and modeling steps.
2. **Video Presentation**: showcasing project highlights.
3. **GitHub Repository**: All code and supporting documentation for the project.
